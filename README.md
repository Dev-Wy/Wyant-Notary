## My Process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
  
### What I learned
- This was my first time working with FileZilla, NameCheap, and any website not hosted on GitHub Pages. I learned a great deal about the web hosting process as well as what it takes to make updates.

### Continued development
- I'd like to add a scheduling calendar and a contact section with comment sections connect to the owner's email.

### Useful Resources: 
- I love W3C School's validation services.
